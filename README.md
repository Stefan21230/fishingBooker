# fishingBooker
This project was created as part of the interview process for Fishing Booker.
The task of this project was to automate the most common scenario on the Fishing Booker website, which is to book a fishing trip for one adult and one child on the first available date of the year. The scenario also included selecting a payment method, paying with a credit card, copying and storing the reservation ID into the txt file.

The project was developed using Python 3.8 programming language and Selenium and Pytest frameworks.

Guide for project setup:
1. Just use python from the fishingBooker-venv\Scripts as interpreter and start test_book_4h_tour.py.
